https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4123/running-a-python-script-at-startup
Here is the solution that I constantly use.

Create a desktop file

xyz.desktop
type the following into it

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Type=Application
Name=<Application Name Goes here>
Comment=
Exec=  python /home/pi/Desktop/execute_on_boot.py
StartupNotify=false
Terminal=true
Hidden=false
paste this file into the

/home/pi/.config/autostart/
and restart your raspberry pi and it should automatically run your program in a new terminal

T:
Here's an even easier method that worked for me. Modify the autostart in LXDE.

Open a terminal and edit the autostart file as follows:

sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
add the following line of text to the bottom(modify the path as needed to where your example.py is located)

@/usr/bin/python /home/pi/example.py
ctr-x, and save. You may need to make the python script executable as follows:

sudo chmod +x /home/pi/example.py
